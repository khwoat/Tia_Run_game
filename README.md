# Tia Run Game
The Tia Run game was created by students in the Object Oriented Programming course at Chiang Mai University, as a project. The game has inspiration from the T-rex game on Google Chrome, but with a dog theme and additional features such as a score system, live system, and new characters. The game was developed using Java language with NetBeans IDE. However, there are some issues with the game, and anyone can try to fix them.
